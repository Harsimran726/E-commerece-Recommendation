## E-commerce Product Recommendation System: Content-Based Filtering

This repository implements a simple yet effective product recommendation system for an e-commerce website. It utilizes a content-based filtering algorithm to suggest products similar to those a user has interacted with in the past.

### Features

* **Content-Based Filtering:** Leverages product descriptions, names, and user activity (likes, views, adding to bag, time spent) to create recommendations.
* **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Converts product features and user activity data into numerical representations using TF-IDF, allowing for efficient similarity calculations.
* **Cosine Similarity:** Calculates the cosine similarity between user interaction profiles and product vectors to identify related items.
* **Prioritization of Added-to-Bag Products:** Gives extra weight to products that have been added to the user's bag, indicating stronger interest.

### Implementation

The recommendation system is implemented using Django, a popular Python framework for building web applications.  The core functionality is contained within the `recommend_products` view, which retrieves user activity and uses the `get_product_recommendations` function to generate personalized suggestions.

### Installation and Setup

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Create a Database:**
   - Configure the database settings in your Django project's `settings.py`.
   - Create the database:
      ```bash
      python manage.py makemigrations
      python manage.py migrate
      ```

3. **Run the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Usage

1. **Track User Activity:**
   - Your e-commerce website should capture and store user activity data, including:
      * Likes
      * Views
      * Adding to Bag
      * Time Spent on Product Pages

2. **Implement Recommendation Views:**
   - Use the `recommend_products` view to display recommendations on product pages or dedicated recommendation sections.

### Customization

* **Feature Extraction:** Modify the `get_product_recommendations` function to include additional features for your products (e.g., categories, brands, colors) or adjust the weighting of existing features.
* **Similarity Algorithm:** Experiment with other similarity measures besides cosine similarity, such as Euclidean distance or Jaccard similarity.
* **Popularity Bias:** Incorporate popularity-based recommendations as a fallback when a user has limited activity.

### Future Enhancements

* **Hybrid Filtering:** Combine content-based filtering with collaborative filtering techniques for more comprehensive recommendations.
* **User Feedback:** Allow users to provide feedback on recommendations, improving the system's accuracy over time.
* **External Libraries:** Explore specialized recommendation engine libraries for more advanced features and algorithms.
